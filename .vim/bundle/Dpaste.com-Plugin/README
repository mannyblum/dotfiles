dpaste.vim is a vim plugin for pasting to dpaste.com (#django's favourite paste bin!)

The core of the script was inspired by LodgeIt.vim, which is also for a paste bin site. 

Thanks to Paul Bissex (or pbx on irc) for creating dpaste.

Usage:
- :Dpaste  (create a paste from the current buffer or selection)

You can also map paste to CTRL + P, just add this to your .vimrc:
map ^P :Dpaste<CR>
(where ^P is entered using CTRL + V, CTRL + P in Vim)
