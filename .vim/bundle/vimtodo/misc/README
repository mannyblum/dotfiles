Autocommit script
=================

Autocommit.sh is a script that will automatically commit and push any changes
to a remote git repository. If you have your todo.txt file stored in a git
repository, then adding this script to your crontab will keep the git
repository up to date.

Configuration is in autocommit.cfg. See the comments for what each option
does.
